# Raspberry-Pi-Python-Scalextric-Lap-Timer
A Python3 based Scalextric lap timer dashboard built on the Raspberry Pi using the Tkinter and GPIO libraries

This is a personal Raspberry Pi 3b project I have been working on for a couple of weeks. My son recently got a Scalextric Sport set and the Arc One base plate. It's not bad, the Android is OK but fun is limited when you are looking a small screen for your lap time or who is leading the race.

I thought I could do a better and make a full screen race control dashboard using the Pi, some Reed sensors and a little Python 3 magic.

It's early days, and I will be extending this dashboard further in the coming weeks with a better UI that defaults to full screen so you can run this on a big TV or monitor at 1080p

### Pre-requisities:
* Reaspberry Pi (40 pin version to follow my setup but will work on and Pi)
* Breadboard + wires etc...
* 1KΩ and 10KΩ resistors
* 2 Reed sensors - Sealed and wired ones are best
* Roboto Font installed to your system
* Python3
* Tkinter Library installed
* GPIO Library installed
* Scalextric Track
* 2 cars with Magnatraction (magnets on the chasis)

More detail to follow, including a Fritzing Diagram of my setup
