# Raspberry-Pi-Python-Scalextric-Lap-Timer
A Python3 based Scalextric lap timer dashboard built on the Raspberry Pi using the Tkinter and GPIO libraries

This is a personal Raspberry Pi 3b project I have been working on for a couple of weeks. My son recently got a Scalextric Sport set and the Arc One base plate. It's not bad, the Android is OK but limited.

I thought I could do a better and make a full screen race control dashboard using Pi, some Reed sensors and a little Python 3 magic.

It's early days, and I will be extending this dashboard further in the coming weeks with a better UI that defaults to full screen so you can run this on a big TV or monitor at 1080p
